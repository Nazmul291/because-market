        "Many of our customers combine lower absorbency products with higher absorbency products so that they can manage their incontinence depending on where they are, the time of day or depending on how their body is working at that moment. So, no matter what your situation we have a product, or a combination of products, that is right for you.",

      faq_question: "Are your bladder protection products soft?",
      faq_answer: [
        "Yes - we've engineered them for maximum comfort, softness, and durability. We listen to what our customers say and make sure that we have soft topsheets (the part that is next to your body) and focus on making sure seams are on the outside of bladder control underwear so that the chances of rubbing are reduced.",

      faq_question: "Do they absorb quickly?",
      faq_answer: [
        "Yes, our pads absorb quickly but it's not just about rapid absorption - you also want products that also protect you from leaks. Our maximum and overnight underwear have double leak guards around the leg openings to provide an extra layer of protection. Our Because Premium Pads feature side leak guards to make sure that even a wet pad can still stop leaks. Finally, you want products that don’t make you feel wet when you’re asleep or before you can make a change. Our products are all designed to stay dry and draw the moisture away from your body quickly, and keep you dry until you can change.",

      faq_question:
        "How do I use bladder protection pads or guards in my existing underwear?",
      faq_answer: [
        "All our bladder protection pads and guards have a sticky side. To use, remove the cover from the sticky side and position the sticky side down in your underwear. Remove and replace as needed. If you are using bladder protection pads or guard within disposable bladder protection underwear to increase absorbency, the sticky back may damage the underwear. You can try applying a little body powder to the sticky backing to reduce the stickiness.",
